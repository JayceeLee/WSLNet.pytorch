# WSLNet.pytorch
An improved Weakly-Supervised Network for Multi-label Classification.

Based on WILDCAT, we modified the architecture of the network and achieved a little promotion.

## Acknowledgement
In this project, we reimplemented our method on PyTorch based on [wildcat.pytorch][https://github.com/wkentaro/pytorch-fcn].
